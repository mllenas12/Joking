# Joking
Joking is an app built with Typescript, that shows jokes obtained from [icanhazdadjoke](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/) and [Chuck Norris](https://api.chucknorris.io/) API randomly. It also fetches data from the [Open Weather API](https://api.openweathermap.org/) to provide the current weather. 

This app was developed in response to a request from a coaching company aiming to measure the impact of humor on employee productivity.
Employees can read jokes before starting their workday and vote on wether the joke was funny.
